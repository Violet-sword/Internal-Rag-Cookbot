## Local RAG Q&A Bot

A lightweight internal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant that answers your questions using a local Embedding model and LLM model via [Ollama](https://ollama.com), powered by LangChain and FAISS.

This version is trained on community-sourced cooking tips, but you can customize it to your own content easily.

## Features

- Fully local RAG setup (no cloud APIs!)
- Uses Ollama-compatible models for both embedding and generation
- Built with LangChain, FAISS, and Python
- Interactive terminal interface
- Fallback to general knowledge if answer isnâ€™t found in local data

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed and running
- pull LLM model and Embedding model from Ollama (change line 18 and 22 of the code accordingly)

Install Python library dependencies:
```bash
pip install langchain langchain-community langchain-ollama faiss-cpu
```

Check if the knowledge base file is in the same directory as "internal-rag-cookbot.py". I have named mine "cooking-tips-comments.txt", the name and contents of the file can be changed. 

## Usage

Run the following command in the directory of the python file. 
```bash
python internal-rag-cookbot.py
```

Type in what you want to ask when the prompt "Your question: " shows up. 

Example use of the code:
```bash
<some-user-directory>:~$ python internal-rag-cookbot.py
